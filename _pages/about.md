Hi, I am a Ph.D. candidate at the School of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, advised by Prof. Wei Yi. My research is centered at the intersection of **radar BEV perception**, **multi-sensor fusion**, and **object dectection and tracking** for autonomous driving systems. I have published several papers at the top international journals and conferences such as **IOT-J**, and **IV**.
